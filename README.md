NEMA-Stepper-Motor-Customizable-Height-Stand
============================================

I only had a 40mm stepper but needed a 48mm for the Z axis on a RepRap Wilson TS. With the 40mm it was unstable until I printed this stand. Problem solved.  Select your stepper motor size (NEMA14, NEMA17, NEMA23).  Select the height you would like the stand to be.  Select the edge height that connects to your stepper.
